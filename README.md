# Heartbeatz Playlist Composer

This application is designed to enhance workouts by synchronizing music beats per minute (BPM) with the user's heart rate. It accepts inputs such as a user's Spotify playlist, favorite artists, and average heart rate, and generates a curated list of songs that not only match the user's musical taste but also align with their heart rate. This project is inspired by research highlighting the benefits of syncing heart rate with music BPM to supercharge workouts.
